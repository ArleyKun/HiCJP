         <h1>Hi, and Happy New Year ulit, Christine!</h1>
         <p>
            So I guess I will start from the moment I first saw you. Na-late ka and doon tayo pinapirma sa science lab, that was back then noong Grade 11 pa tayo, and I've gotta be real, my eyes were drawn to you almost immediately and I couldn’t take my eyes off of you. Those eyes, that smile... Like I could see how really demure you were, and I swear, it was like one of the most beautiful things I had ever seen. 
         <p>
            Starting that day, I started to look for you in the hallways, and I'd always see you dun sa kapehan after class. We haven't really interacted kasi I fully understood na wala talaga akong chance sa'yo. Like how could I, when you literally were Aphrodite in disguise, and I was just... well.. me. 
         <p>
            In the space of time, naging magkaklase tayo for this s.y. (destiny ba ito? Jk). I don't really read books/reading materials but the fact that you were my classmate, it made me do that. I thought of a way to talk to you kahit papaano, and so I always messaged you about reviewers and stuff, siguro halata na ako, sorry halata. And as you know, life saver talaga kita since then. And yeah.. you know the rest naman na siguro.. I also wanna say sorry ulit sa mga ganap sa room natin, but I'm glad you're okay with it hehe..
         <p>
            And yun nga, I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for something that might sound a little cheesy, but it’s true. You’ve been my inspiration for coming to class every day (keme 😁😁). So, I guess this is my way of saying thank you, not just for being there but for being you. You might not even realize the impact you have on people around you, but trust me, it’s huge. I hope you know you’re appreciated, not just by me but by everyone lucky enough to have you in their life. 😊
            <br><br>
            Thank you for being you, Christine.
